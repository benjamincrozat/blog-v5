## Dependency policy

This file exists to prevent “installing our way out” of design problems.

## Instructions

- Prefer existing utilities and framework features over new packages.
- For small features, prefer writing your own code instead of adding a dependency.
- When you truly need a dependency, you need strong arguments and the user's approval.
