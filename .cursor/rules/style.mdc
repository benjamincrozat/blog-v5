- Always import namespaces.
- Take inspiration from the codebase.
- Avoid one letter or ambiguous variable names.
- Don't create a variable if it's used only once.
- Comments start with a capital letter and end with a period.
- Use Real-Time Facades in tests to mock something pulled from the container.
- I like to not feel claustrophobic in my code. Use space between control structures.
- Run `php vendor/bin/pint --parallel` to format the code whenever you make a change.
- Prefer generating code through Artisan commands to stay up to date with the latest changes.
- Use helper functions instead of Facades if available. E.g., session() instead of Session::get().
- When you write tests, run and fix them until they pass. (Use the --parallel option to speed up the process.)
- In tests, fake OpenAI calls using OpenAI::fake() with Responses CreateResponse::fake() instead of mocking from scratch.
